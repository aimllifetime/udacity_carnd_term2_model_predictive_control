# CarND-Controls-MPC
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program.

Term2 final project: Model Predictive Control

The achieved reference speed is 100MPH. The video record is here:[video](./output/record.mov)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Implementation

The model uses 6 state variable vector to describe the car in current state:[px, py, psi, v, cte, epsi]
where
px: the car position of x-axis.
py: the car position of y-axis.
psi:the orientation of the vehicle in radiansconverted from the Unity format to the standard format expected in most mathemetical functions.
v: The current velocity of car in mph
cte: the cross track error
epsi: the error orentation compared to ideal situation.

In the main.cpp, upon every websocket message, the car position and waypoints are extracted from the message. Then subtract the car position[px, py] from the waypoint so that move the co-ordinate origin to car position. Then rotates the system by the current car orientation in psi so that in new co-ordinates, ideal desired car orentation is along the x-axis such that the CTE simply becomes the y-axis offset and counter-clock orentatioin is negative PSI(left turn) and clock-wise orentation PSI(right turn).

Here is the pusduo code:

* Step 1: co-ordinate translation
     // do the clock wise PSI rotation
     
    ``` 
     foreach waypoint in waypoints{
       waypoint_x_offset = waypoint[px] - car[px]
       waypoint_y_offset = waypoint[py] - car[py]
       waypoint[px] = waypoint_x_offset * cos(0-psi) - waypoint_y_offset*sin(0-psi))
       waypoint[py] = waypoint_x_offset * sin(0-psi) + waypoint_y_offset*cos(0-psi))
     }
     ```
     
* Step 2: Polyfit the waypoints to find the coeffs
   Simply call the polyfit witht the waypoints from step1 to fit them into polynomial of order of 3.
   
* Step 3: Calcuate the CTE and epsi
   The CTE becomes straightforward by simply apply the polyeval at origin of zero where car is positioned, i.e. polyeval(coeffs, 0)
   The epsi, error orentation is the angle of atan of first derivative of the polynomial at car position, i.e. new origion.
   first derivative(fd1) = coeffs[1] + 2 * px * coeffs[2] + 3 * coeffs * px * px
   since px in new coordinate is of zero, above becomes: fd1 = coeffs[1]
   so the error orentation is epsi = psi - atan(coeffs[1]) = - atan(coeff[1] since PSI desired is of zero to drive along x-axis.
   
* step 4: calcuate the steering angle and throttle using the MPC, such as
      vars = mpc.Solve(state, coeffs)
      
* step 5: normalize the angle to  [ -25, 25] in radias and display the waypoints and projected path to simulator. The actuator is normalized between [-1, 1] when MPC:Solve. no further action is needed.

**FG_eval**: The model update constraint is govened by following fomula in Class FG_eval:

* Cost fg[0] has the cost of various conditions:
     1. CTE of N steps
     2. epsi of N steps
     3. speed offset to reference speed(100MPH in the final submission)
     4. orentation error
     5. actuation 
     6. difference of current orentation and previous orentation error
     7. difference of current actuation and previous actuation
     
* model state update formula:
     ![x](./output/x.gif)
     ![y](./output/y.gif)
     ![psi](./output/psi.gif)
     ![v](./output/v.gif)
     ![cte](./output/cte.gif)
     ![epsi](./output/epsi.gif)
     
     note the minus sign before ![d](./output/vl.gif) is different from class. the reason is because that note if Î´ is positive we rotate counter-clockwise, or turn left. In the simulator however, a positive value implies a right turn and a negative value implies a left turn. Due to this we switch the + sign to - sign.
     
* Constraits
     delta is between [-25, 25] degree
     a is between [-1, 1] for acuation.


### Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)
In order to run speed at 100MPH, every second the travelled distance is about 100 * 1609m/3600s = 45meters.

The waypoints given from simulator is almost a straight line, the euclian distance from the start to end is about 55m.

42["telemetry",{"ptsx":[-32.16173,-43.49173,-61.09,-78.29172,-93.05002,-107.7717],"ptsy":[113.361,105.941,92.88499,78.73102,65.34102,50.57938],"psi_unity":4.12033,"psi":3.733651,"x":-40.62,"y":108.73,"steering_angle":0,"throttle":0,"speed":2.628028}]

distance = ![distance](./output/distance.gif) = 55m

so in order to predict the distance by waypoints, we need 55/44 = 1.25s

so if we choose N = 10, then dt = 0.125. This is how I set the N and dt.

or if choose bigger N such as 20, dt = 0.0625. However, the calculation of Jacob and Hassian matrix will take longer time and model is not able to catch up the incoming message processing.

### Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing
This has been covered in above model implemenation. Step 1 does the preprocessing the waypoints to move the origin or coordinate to car system for the waypoints. Then does the rotation of the waypoints clock wise by PSI. After the rotation is done then use polyfit to fit the new waypoints.
* Step 1: co-ordinate translation
     // do the clock wise PSI rotation
    ``` 
     foreach waypoint in waypoints{
       waypoint_x_offset = waypoint[px] - car[px]
       waypoint_y_offset = waypoint[py] - car[py]
       newwaypoint_x[px] = waypoint_x_offset * cos(0-psi) - waypoint_y_offset*sin(0-psi))
       newwaypoint_y[py] = waypoint_x_offset * sin(0-psi) + waypoint_y_offset*cos(0-psi))
     }
     ```
* Step 2: Polyfit the waypoints to find the coeffs
   Simply call the polyfit witht the waypoints from step1 to fit them into polynomial of order of 3.

The coeffs = polyfit(newwaypoint_x, newwaypoint_y, 3);
